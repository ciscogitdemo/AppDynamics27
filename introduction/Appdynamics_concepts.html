This global view across your application landscape allows you to quickly navigate through the distributed application into the call graphs and exception reports that individual hosts generate. <h2>User Interface Link to User Interface </h2> Appdynamics provides a Controller Tenant to collect, store, analyze, and baseline the performance data collected by agents and a Controller Tenant UI to view and manage the information. You access the AppDynamics Controller Tenant UI through a URL that uses your Account name. Each Controller Tenant has a distinct set of users, reporting agents, and application monitoring configuration. AppDynamics can host one or more accounts, where each account represents one Controller Tenant. AppDynamics SaaS deployment is a multi-tenant environment that allows you to access multiple Controller Tenants independently. Application Performance MonitoringLink to Application Performance Monitoring At the tier level, AppDynamics provides a view of the runtime operation of your code via an AppDynamics App Server Agent. The agent detects calls to a service entry point at the tier and follows the execution path for the call through the call stack. It sends data about usage metrics, code exceptions, exit calls to backend systems, and error conditions to your Controller Tenant. See Install App Server Agents. </pre> </body> </html>
