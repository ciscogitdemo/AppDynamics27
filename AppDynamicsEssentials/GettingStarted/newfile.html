<h1>Metrics and Graphs- test</h1><p>This page describes metrics and graphs in AppDynamics.</p><p>AppDynamics reports metrics for monitored systems over time.&nbsp;The Controller provides a variety of graphs and tools that visualize metric data so you can effectively analyze your application's performance.</p><h2>Metric Visualization Tools</h2><p>While metric data appears throughout the Controller, the Metric Browser is the main interface for you to inspect metrics.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Metric Browser&nbsp;displays all the metric values collected over the selected time period as an expandable tree.&nbsp;</p><p>In the browser, you can drag and drop metrics from the tree onto graphs to compare metrics and analyze patterns.</p><h2>Metrics</h2><p>AppDynamics includes a wealth of metrics that reflect your application's performance. It also lets you extend and adapt metrics in specific ways. Information points, for example, allow you&nbsp;to create metrics based on data collected from application values, such as method parameters or return values. Percentile metrics let you configure metrics at deviation points that are useful to you.</p>
