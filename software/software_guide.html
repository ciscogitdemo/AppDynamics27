It is important to plan your AppDynamics deployment according to your environment. Taking time to outline your system strategy provides a smooth process flow. You can use these guidelines to start working with AppDynamics. Each AppDynamics customer account is a tenant of the AppDynamics cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform. AppDynamics refers to this as a Controller Tenant. Once you install the necessary agents, AppDynamics automatically builds an environment of the chosen applications. The Controller Tenant: Monitors your application workload. Uses machine learning to determine what is normal for your environment. Applies sensible defaults for detecting abnormal activity and application errors. You can start using AppDynamics dashboards, flow maps, and monitoring tools in the Controller Tenant UI immediately without instrumentation and configuration. Later, you can customize the configuration for your specific environment and requirements. </pre> </body> </html>
